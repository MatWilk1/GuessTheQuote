# GuessTheQuote
My first app :)

Easy quiz game where player guesses quotes from books or famous people. Polish version only.
Program uses excel file as a base of quotations and best scores (three different sheets: "books", "people" and "scores"). In repository can find example of this file but without real quotes (you can add there as many quotes as you want).

To communicate with Excel file program uses "openpyxl" library.
