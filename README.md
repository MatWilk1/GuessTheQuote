# GuessTheQuote
My first app :)

Easy quiz game where player guesses quotes from books or famous people. Polish version only.

Program uses "QuotesBase.xlsx" file as a base of quotations and best scores (three different sheets: "books", "people" and "scores"). In repository you can find example of this file but without real quotes (you can add there as many quotes as you want but you can't change file and sheets names).

Program uses "openpyxl" library to communicate with .xlsx files.
